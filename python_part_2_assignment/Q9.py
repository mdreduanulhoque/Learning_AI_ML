Q9. Write a function is_prime(n)
False otherwise, using a loop.

that returns True if n is a prime number and

[Hint -

1. We only check prime for 2 or numbers greater than 2. 2 is the smallest
prime number.

2. A non-Prime number, n , will always get divided by atleast one number in
range [2, n-1].

Eg - For number 9 we'll check in range (2, 8) & it'll get divided by 3. So 9 is
non-prime & we'll return false for it.

For number 7 we'll check in range (2, 6) & it won't get divided by any. So 7
is prime & we'll return true for it. ]
